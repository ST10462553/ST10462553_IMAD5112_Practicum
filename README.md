## Introduction:
Welcome! this ReadMe file is meant to discuss the contents of my Practicum exam. I wish to give readers a breakdown of the purpose of the app, the content in the app and the overall expectation that users should have towards navigating the app( which is to track the weeks weather forecast)

## The purpose of the app:
The purpose of the app is for:
* Users to be able to access weekly weather forecasts
* Have a good user-friendly with a UI that gives users swift navigation through app
* Ability to change user input should users make a faulty upon typing
* Bring user satisfaction without falsifying the written data
* Use arrays and functions to be able to calculate the average temperatures for the week
* Capture/ restore data written in the app.


## The elements on the app:
The app includes a screen displaying the weather's conditions (temperatures) with their respective days of the week as well as explanatory weather conditions like: 
* Sunny
*  Raining
*   Cold
In the app, users should be confronted by a number of buttons to choose from which enables users to navigate the app as well as add input to aspects like temperatures in the week spanning from "Min" to "Max"
**The activities(screens)**
1. The main Activity:
- the contents on the main activity include:
  - a designated logo for the app - it displays the sun and the words "Weather Castro- The weather forecast in one click" - symbolic to its purpose as a supposed becon to inform people of the weather updates.
  - the options to either exit the app or navigate to the Main screen or Main Menu, which will show the user the days, temperatures and the option to exit the app or go further into the app namely getting a detailed view of the weather forecast. This will not only display to users the temperatures but the range from minimal to maximum weather temperatures along with a detailed part of the screen which shows the average temperature of the week.
  - the user will also have an option to clear their input should they have made a mistake in the course of typing in the weather.
 
    2. The app is supposed to carry out functions to endure error- handling, this is for when users make a mistake in their input.
   As displayed below the app boasts its very own app icon and the very top image is the screen before users are taken into the Main screen.

    ##The link to the Presentation:
This presentation is supposed to give a more bite-sized walk-through to the app with pleasing visual aids that will grasp readers attention. It is a quick read to the practicum, which I'd advice readers to view for a more neat and swift reading experience. Click the link below to view my PowerPoint presentation:

## The flowchart for minimum and maximum temperature:

This here is the link to my flowchart, unfortunately I couldn't copy and paste the image onto my ReadMe. So alternatively, I shared the link for anyone who is interested in viewing the logic towards minimum and maximum temperature (user input) :

## Final words: 
This experience has not been an easy one because I found that attempting the concepts covered on the practicum were by far the hardest, needless to say I enjoyed designing a weather app and am optimistic in fixing errors encountered during this exam. I enjoyed yet another experience to become a potentially good programmer in this kind of field of work and for that I am greatful.It takes time, patience and determination to get far in not only programming but in life as well and I am forever greatful to my lecturer for teaching me these programming concepts. I wouldn't have dreamt of doing programming when I was younger but in the present day I finally learned that programming and coding is a skill all of us can obtain in exception to practicing consistently.Thank you.
